## 1. [High] Dual transaction nature of composed message transfer allows anyone to steal user funds

### Restricts the lzCompose(‚Ä¶) method

- Summary: Sending OFTs via `lzCompose(‚Ä¶)` is permissionless, allowing anyone to invoke it. Adversaries can monitor for incoming OFTs and use them before legitimate processing, stealing user funds. If `lzCompose(‚Ä¶)` fails, adversaries can exploit retries before users, misusing the OFTs.

- Impact & Recommendation: An immediate but temporary fix restricts the lzCompose(‚Ä¶) method to trusted or whitelisted executors. Alternatively, a design change is proposed, involving directly implementing `lzReceive(‚Ä¶)` to eliminate the need for a composed message altogether.

## 2. [Medium] ASDRouter didn‚Äôt call ASDUSDC.approve() to to grant permission for crocSwapAddress to spend their ASDUSDC

### Lack of allowance

- Summary: The function `ASDRouter#lzCompose()` fails because the necessary allowance is not set for `crocSwapAddres**s**` to spend ASDUSDC tokens. This prevents the successful swap of ASDUSDC for NOTE, resulting in a failed execution of `_swapOFTForNote()` and refunding all ASDUSDC to the designated receiver.

- Impact & Recommendation: Set¬†`allowance`¬†to the maximum value.

## 3.[High] DOS of completeQueuedWithdrawal when ERC20 buffer is filled

### Restricted access

- Summary: The OperatorDelegator::completeQueuedWithdrawal function in the code tries to fill the ERC20 withdrawal buffer but fails because it calls depositQueue::fillERC20withdrawBuffer, which is restricted to be accessed only by the RestakeManager contract. This restriction causes the function call to revert, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) that prevents the completion of withdrawals and the retrieval of funds from EigenLayer (EL), resulting in a potential loss of funds for the protocol and its users.

- Impact & Recommendation: The simplest solution is to remove the onlyRestakeManager modifier from the depositQueue::fillERC20withdrawBuffer function, allowing anyone to call it.

## 4.[High] Availability of deposit invariant can be bypassed

### ETH deposits influence lpETH minting

- Summary: The issue in the PrelaunchPoints.sol contract arises during the claiming of lpETH, where non-ETH/WETH LRT tokens are swapped to ETH using \_fillQuote(), and this ETH is subsequently used to mint lpETH. The vulnerability occurs because any ETH transferred directly to the contract before calling claim() is also included in the minting calculation. This allows users to bypass the intended lock-up period and artificially inflate their lpETH holdings beyond their initial LRT stake.

- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this, it is crucial to modify the contract so that only ETH obtained from LRT swaps is used for minting lpETH, and to prevent any additional ETH deposits from influencing the lpETH minting process.
