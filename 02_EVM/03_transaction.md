## 1.[Medium] Discrepancy in ECRECOVER Precompile when Using Delegatecall

### Delegatecall to precompile

- Summary: When the ECRECOVER precompile contract is invoked using delegatecall, it does not behave consistently with other zkSync Era operations like call and staticcall.
- Impact & Recommendation: This divergence from expected EVM behavior can lead to incorrect signature validation, potentially compromising data integrity and user funds. If the **`_address`** matches the ECRECOVER precompile contract (0x01), it's recommended to perform a static call (**`rawStaticCall`**) instead of a delegate call to ensure consistent behavior with the ECRECOVER contract.

## 2.[Medium] Discrepancy in Default Account Behavior

### Reverts in fallback function

- Summary: Default accounts mimic externally owned accounts (EOAs) on Ethereum, but a discrepancy arises when custom accounts delegate-calls to them, triggering a revert due to an `assert(msg.sender != BOOTLOADER_FORMAL_ADDRESS)` in the default account's fallback function.
- Impact & Recommendation: One proposed solution is to add a modifier called **`ignoreInDelegateCall`** to the fallback function of default accounts, which prevents the assertion check from executing when the fallback function is invoked via a delegate call.

    }

## 3.[Medium] Nonce Behavior Discrepancy Between zkSync Era and EIP-161

### Create & nonce

- Summary: The **`CREATE3`** library facilitates EVM contract creation similar to **`CREATE2`**, but it excludes the contract **`initCode`** from the address derivation formula. It involves deploying a new proxy contract using the **`CREATE2`** method, which then deploys the child contract using **`CREATE`**. The child contract's address is computed based on the proxy contract's address and its hardcoded nonce `**hex"01‚Äù**` ,which aligns with EIP-161. However, in the zkSync Era, where the nonce does not increment by one as expected, this mechanism unexpectedly fails compared to the EVM.
- Impact & Recommendation: It is recommended to increase the deployment nonce of a contract by one before calling its constructor.

## 4.[Medium] Permit doesn‚Äôt work with DAI

### DAI permit

- Summary: The issue arises from using the depositWithPermit function in PrizeVault.sol with permit options, intending to utilize sDAI but encountering discrepancies with DAI's permit signature. The problem stems from the missing nonce field in DAI's permit function, causing permit transactions to revert due to incorrect parameters.

- Impact & Recommendation: For the special case of DAI token, allow a different implementation of the permit function which allows a nonce variable.

## 5.[Medium] Reorg attack on user‚Äôs Vault deployment and deposit may lead to theft of funds

### Create & chain reorgs

- Summary: Attacks exploiting chain reorganizations can steal deployed Vaults and deposits. By front-running a user's Vault deployment, including their deposit, and then withdrawing the funds, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the deployment process. This medium-severity issue poses a high impact but is less likely to occur.

- Impact & Recommendation: Vault instances should use create2 with a salt based on id, minter, and msg.sender for deployment.

## 6.[Medium] Reorg attack on user‚Äôs Vault deployment and deposit may lead to theft of funds

### src == msg.sender

- Summary: In mimswap's Router.sol file, the createPoolETH method wraps native tokens to their "wrapped" counterpart before sending them to a new pool. However, on chains like Blast, Wrapped Arbitrum, and Wrapped Fantom, using address(weth).safeTransferFrom causes approval issues due to differences in WETH implementations that lacks this src == msg.sender handling.

- Impact & Recommendation: To fix the issue preventing the creation of native token pools on multiple chains like Blast due to Router contract's failure to approve spending WETH tokens, modify Router.sol by replacing `safeTransferFrom` with `safeTransfer`.

## 7.[High] Native gas tokens can become stuck in ASDRouter contract

### msg.value stucked

- Summary: Excess gas sent to the ASDRouter contract gets stuck there after successful ASD token transfers, which is not refunded to the sender's address, but held in the ASDRouter contract. This violates the rule that the ASDRouter's native balance should always be zero.

- Impact & Recommendation: The suggested changes to the `_sendASD()` method in the ASDRouter contract will refund any leftover ether (gas) back to the specified refund address, preventing it from getting stuck in the contract after successful ASD token transfers.

## 8. Same contract multi permits fundamentally cannot be solved via the chosen standards

### MEV by permit signatures

- Summary: Cross-chain USDO and TOFT flows using approvals may be vulnerable to DoS attacks through permit-based griefing. Attackers can exploit front-run exploits by monitoring permit signatures in the mempool and executing them before intended transactions, rendering transactions ineffective. This limits Tapioca's architecture to single signature without revokes.
- Impact & Recommendation: Use Permits for granting approvals(with try-catch), avoiding their use for revoking approvals to prevent front-run exploits. Suggest granting higher allowances and implementing renounceAllowance for TOFT tokens to enforce a secure allowance pattern.

## 9.[Medium] The signatures are replayable

### No Nonce and check

- Summary: User-signed orders lack a nonce, making signatures replayable and allowing the same order to be reused multiple times. The system only verifies the user's signature without ensuring the signed order matches the parameters used in execution, which can lead to unauthorized actions and potential fund loss.

- Impact & Recommendation: The recommended fix is to add a nonce and verify that operator parameters align with the user's signed order.

## 10.[High] refinanceFull/addNewTranche reusing a lender‚Äôs signature leads to unintended behavior

### Reuse signature

- Summary: The `refinanceFull` and `addNewTranche` functions in the `MultiSourceLoan` contract use the same signature from `RenegotiationOffer`. This allows a malicious user to reuse the signature intended for `refinanceFull` to execute `addNewTranche`, leading to unintended and risky behavior.

- Impact & Recommendation: Introduce a `type` field in `RenegotiationOffer` to differentiate between the types of operations (`refinanceFull` and `addNewTranche`). This would prevent the misuse of signatures intended for one operation being used in another.

## 11.[Medium] A malicious user can frontrun permit transaction to make it revert due to invalid signature

### Front-run a permit

- Summary: In the StrategOperatorProxy and StrategUserInteractions smart contracts, a vulnerability was identified where a malicious user could front-run a permit transaction, causing the signature to become invalid and resulting in transaction reversion. The issue stemmed from the executePermit() function, which directly called asset.permit() with the permit signature, allowing attackers to exploit this by using the signature before it was properly validated.

- Impact & Recommendation: Wrap the asset.permit() call in a try-catch block.

## 12.[Medium] signedHash should contain \_vault in vaultWithdrawalRebalance()

- summary: In the `StrategOperatorProxy` smart contract, the `vaultWithdrawalRebalance()` function allowed users to provide a signature for authority actions without including the `_vault` parameter in the `signedHash`. This omission allowed users to potentially use `dynParamsExit` in any vault, which could have unintended side effects across different vaults with varying strategies.

## 13.[Medium] Users can bypass limits and purchase more licenses than allowed by re-entering functions

### Re-entrancy via call

- Summary: The `PlayFiLicenseSale` contract has a vulnerability in the `claimLicensePartner()` and `claimLicensePublic()` functions where the commission is sent via a low-level call before state variables are updated. This allows for re-entrancy, enabling users to bypass purchase limits and acquire more licenses than allowed. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious contract to re-enter the purchase function.

- Impact & Recommendation: Use `nonReentrant` modifiers on affected functions and transfer commissions after updating state variables.
