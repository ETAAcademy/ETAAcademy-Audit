## 1.[Medium] Timestamp Constraints Leading to Number of Blocks Creation Limitations

### Different timestamp constraints between batches and blocks

- Summary : The constraints on timestamp differences between batches and their respective blocks in zkSync lead to smaller batch sizes, and prohibits the simultaneous commitment of two batches on L1 within the same Ethereum block, causing bottlenecks during high transaction volumes and block space utilization.
- Impact & Recommendation: The current timestamp verification process on L1 and L2 exacerbates these issues, necessitating stricter constraints to prevent batches with future timestamps. Mitigation steps should involve applying stricter timestamp constraints on both L1 and L2.

    Batch 1000:



    Batch timestamp: X + COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_APPROXIMATION_DELTA - 1.

    Timestamp of the last block (fictive block) in this batch: X + COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_APPROXIMATION_DELTA.

    The time this batch is committed on L1: blockTimestamp1000.

    X <= blockTimestamp1000.



    Batch 1001:



    Batch timestamp: X + COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_APPROXIMATION_DELTA + Y.

    Timestamp of the last block (fictive block) in this batch: X + COMMIT_TIMESTAMP_APPROXIMATION_DELTA + Y + K.

    The time this batch is committed on L1: blockTimestamp1001.

## 2. [High] Validity and contests bond ca be incorrectly burned for the correct and ultimately verified transition

### Verify transition

- Summary: Both validity and contest bonds can be erroneously slashed even if the transition is ultimately correct and verified. This occurs because the history of the final verified transition is not considered, leading to situations where participants lose their bonds unjustly. In such scenarios, ts.prover acts as the guardian and is responsible for the final proof of the block.

- Impact & Recommendation: It suggests to enable guardians to refund validity and contest bonds similar to liveness bonds, ensuring bond recovery if a prover or contester is proven correct. Additionally, rewards sent to guardians during proof verification should not be recovered to avoid locking funds in TaikoL1.

## 3. [High] Taiko L1 - Proposer can maliciously cause loss of funds by forcing someone else to pay prover‚Äôs fee

### Pay prover‚Äôs fee

- Summary: The libProposing library lets a proposer set the person for assigned prover fees. Malicious actors can exploit this by setting the person to another user's address, forcing them to pay fees for block proposals made by the malicious actor. This can happen if a user's approval allowance for spending tokens exceeds the actual fee they intend to pay.

- Impact & Recommendation: To prevent malicious actors from forcing others to pay fees for block proposals, a simple fix is to ensure that the block proposer always remains the msg.sender.

## 3. [Medium] Taiko L1 - Proposer can maliciously cause loss of funds by forcing someone else to pay prover‚Äôs fee

### Proving tier

- Summary: The `getMinTier()` function determines the minimum proving tier required for proposing a block based on a random number `_rand`. If this number meets a specific condition, a more expensive tier is required; otherwise, a cheaper one suffices. However, since the random number can be predicted in advance, proposers may choose to wait for a cheaper tier, causing delays in transaction finalization.

- Impact & Recommendation: Consider using VRF like solutions to make¬†`_rand`¬†truly random.

## 4. [Medium] Taiko SGX Attestation - Improper validation in certchain decoding

### Improper validation

- Summary: In Taiko's ZK proof setup, SGX provers leverage remote attestation via Automata's modular attestation layer. The process involves decoding the certificate chain, validating notBefore and notAfter tags. However, a flaw in the validation logic allows an attestor to pass any value for the notBefore tag, compromising the integrity of the attestation process. This oversight poses a significant risk to the security and trustworthiness of SGX provers within Taiko's setup, highlighting the importance of rectifying the validation issue promptly.

- Impact & Recommendation: Updating the condition to `(notBeforeTag != 0x17 && notBeforeTag != 0x18)` will prevent improper validation and mitigate unforeseen consequences.

## 5. [Medium] Improper adjustment of Lending Ledger configuration

### Improper configuration for both rewards and block time parameters

- Summary: The LendingLedger's method for adjusting time-related parameters and rewards is insecure, potentially leading to retroactive application of adjustments to markets not yet updated. While warnings exist in the code, they are deemed insufficient to prevent over- or under-estimations of rewards attributed to markets.

- Impact & Recommendation: Track and update all markets together when adjusting parameters or rewards in LendingLedger. This can be done by iterating through all markets to ensure simultaneous updates, either by tracking the total number of markets or by providing an input array of markets. Additionally, for setRewards function, restrict mutations to future epochs to prevent retroactive adjustments.
