## 1.[Medium] BOLDUpgradeAction.sol will fail to upgrade contracts due to error in the perform function

### Upgrade contracts

- Summary: The vulnerability in `checkClaimIdLink` allows an edge to inherit timers from its rival's children due to inadequate checks. This flaw can be exploited to inflate an edge's timer, enabling near-instant confirmation of any level 0 edge by repeatedly using a proved proof node and its ancestors or rivals. This occurs because only the originId and mutualId match is checked, allowing edges to inherit timers they shouldn't.

- Impact & Recommendation: Allow child edges to inherit the claimId of their parent and ensure the claiming edge's claimId matches the edgeId of the inheriting edge.

## 2.[High] createPoolD650E2D0 will not work due to mismatch in solidity and stylus function definitions

### Mismatch function definitions

- Summary: A mismatch between the `createPoolD650E2D0` function definitions in Solidity and Stylus causes direct calls to fail and rendering pool creation functionality inaccessible via this specific function. While a fallback mechanism exists to allow pool creation using the correct ABI, this workaround does not align with the intended design, where the function should operate as specified.

- Impact & Recommendation: A recommended fix involves removing the unnecessary parameters to align the function with its counterpart in Stylus.

## 3.[Medium] cancelSwapRequest() old orderInfo using new swap causing failure to cancel

### Cancellation failures

- Summary: In the `AssetController.sol` contract, the `cancelSwapRequest()` method had a logic flaw where it used the updated `swap` address from the factory even after the `swap` had been changed using `AssetFactory.setSwap()`. This resulted in old order information (`orderInfo`) being processed with the new `swap` address, causing cancellation failures for old orders.

- Impact & Recommendation: To address this, a fix was implemented in commit `@2ac8fff8b32e`, which introduced a `swapAddress` parameter to ensure that each operation explicitly uses the correct `swap` address. Additionally, the `addMintRequest` method was updated to record the `swapAddress` for each request, ensuring consistency in subsequent operations.
