# AI-Driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems: Enterprise Networks, Industrial IoT, and Robotic System Protection

IDS detects threats by observing network traffic and issuing alerts, while IPS builds upon detection capabilities to actively mitigate threats. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), as core technologies in network security, have evolved from traditional signature-based and anomaly detection open-source tools like Snort to artificial intelligence-driven systems that integrate machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

Modern IDPS employs multi-layered architectural design, integrating multi-source data through data collection layers and utilizing AI technologies such as Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptrons (DLMLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to process large-scale datasets, achieving high-precision detection and low false-positive classification for various attacks including DDoS, MITM, and Mirai. The system's core AI threat detection engine combines supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning models, optimizing processing effectiveness through feature extraction, PCA dimensionality reduction, and time series analysis, while the automated response layer implements real-time mitigation measures such as firewall rule generation, instance isolation, and zero-trust architecture.

Addressing the special requirements of IoT and robotic systems, blockchain-assisted intelligent protection architectures and specialized Robot Intrusion Prevention Systems (RIPS) have been developed. The latter, based on ROS and DDS middleware, achieves comprehensive threat detection from message-level to graph-structure-level through three categories of expression syntax: Message events, Graph events, and External events. It integrates the advantages of tools like HAROS and ROS-FM, supports centralized, distributed, and hybrid cloud deployment models, and achieves scalability optimization through technologies such as federated learning, AutoML, and GPU acceleration, providing complete intelligent security protection solutions from traffic monitoring, anomaly identification, and threat assessment to response execution. Although challenges remain in areas such as adversarial attacks, data privacy, and computational overhead, the field is advancing toward next-generation network security technologies including self-healing, blockchain enhancement, and quantum AI.

## 1. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is designed to identify potential intrusions by monitoring network traffic. It can detect network attacks on vulnerable services, privilege escalation attempts, unauthorized access to sensitive files, and malicious software such as viruses, worms, and trojans. Once suspicious activity is detected, an IDS generates an alert.

An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** goes a step further: in addition to detecting malicious activity, it actively takes measures to mitigate threats. IDS focuses on monitoring and reporting, while IPS can block or modify traffic in real time.

IDS typically operates by:

- **Monitoring traffic** for potential threats
- **Extracting features** from data for further analysis
- **Logging incidents** for historical comparison and behavioral pattern recognition

IPS compares current traffic with previously established behavioral patterns to identify anomalies. It integrates with firewalls, switches, and routers to segment traffic and enforce controls. IPS can terminate malicious connections, block IPs, reset sessions, or even alter malicious payloads to render them harmless.

#### Types of IPS

**Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS)**:
Deployed at the network level, NIPS monitors both wired and wireless traffic. It uses techniques such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), traffic analysis, and machine learning models. Threats can be mitigated by dropping suspicious packets or resetting connections.

**Host Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)**:
Installed on endpoints, HIPS analyzes and filters traffic at the host level. It can monitor file integrity, system logs, and user activity. Common techniques include Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR).

**Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS)**:
Focused on wireless traffic, WIPS detects misconfigured access points, man-in-the-middle attacks, and MAC address spoofing.

**Network Behavior Analysis (NBA)**:
Examines traffic flows to detect anomalies such as DoS and DDoS attacks.

#### IPS Detection Methods

IPS technologies employ several approaches:

- **Signature-based IPS**: Uses predefined attack signatures (patterns) to detect known threats. This is effective but requires constant updates.
- **Anomaly-based IPS**: Identifies deviations from normal traffic profiles defined by engineers. This includes both statistical and non-statistical anomaly detection.
- **Policy-based IPS**: Enforces organizational security policies; violations trigger alerts.
- **Protocol analysis IPS**: Goes beyond basic signature matching by deeply inspecting packet structure and protocol behavior.

#### Common IDS/IPS Tools

Numerous commercial and open-source tools are available, each with different capabilities:

- **Snort**: An open-source IDS/IPS providing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging. It supports custom rules for inline packet dropping.
- **Suricata**: A high-performance alternative to Snort, offering multi-threaded processing and broader protocol support.
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)**: Focused on network behavior analysis and traffic logging.
- **OSSEC**: A host-based IDS, providing log analysis, file integrity monitoring, and alerting.

### Snort in IDS and IPS Modes

Snort can run in two main modes:

- **IDS Mode**: Operates passively on a single interface, monitoring traffic (e.g., ICMP) without dropping packets. Suspicious activity triggers alerts.
- **IPS Mode**: Deployed inline using virtual bridges and veth interfaces. Packets can be actively dropped based on defined rules. Snort uses the **afpacket** mechanism for inline traffic interception.

For example, a Snort rule can block ICMP echo requests (ping traffic) to simulate attack scenarios. In IPS mode, Snort dropped all ICMP packets during testing, confirmed by 100% packet loss on the target host.

#### Email Alerts with Python Integration

Snort can be enhanced with real-time alerting through email. A Python script (`snort_email_alert.py`) was implemented using the **Yagmail** library with Gmail’s SMTP service. The script monitors `/var/log/snort/alert`, extracts relevant details (protocol, TTL, TOS, packet ID, datagram length), and sends structured alerts to administrators.

The script requires `sudo` privileges to access Snort logs but, once configured, provides immediate notifications whenever suspicious activity (e.g., ICMP ping flood) is detected.

#### Benefits and Limitations

For educational institutions or small businesses, a Snort-based IDS/IPS provides a **flexible and cost-effective** solution. Users benefit from:

- Customizable rules
- Extensive logging capabilities
- Strong community support

However, limitations include:

- Lack of a graphical management interface
- No automatic signature updates
- Limited scalability compared to enterprise-grade solutions

Commercial products such as **Cisco Firepower** or **Palo Alto Networks** provide integrated UIs, automated threat intelligence, and high availability features. But they come at significantly higher complexity and cost.

## 2. AI-Powered Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the landscape of intrusion detection and prevention by enabling systems that are not only reactive but also adaptive and predictive. **AI-driven IDPS** integrate **machine learning (ML)**, **deep learning (DL)**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **reinforcement learning (RL)** to enhance real-time threat detection, adaptive anomaly recognition, and automated response.

By leveraging advanced techniques such as **unsupervised learning**, **generative adversarial networks (GANs)**, **federated learning**, and **explainable AI (XAI)**, modern IDPS can evolve dynamically to detect novel attack vectors with high accuracy and reduced false positives. Furthermore, they utilize **big data analytics**, **predictive modeling**, and **behavioral analysis** to strengthen cybersecurity resilience in complex environments such as cloud computing.

However, challenges remain, including **adversarial AI attacks**, **data privacy risks**, **model drift**, and **computational overhead**, which can complicate real-world deployment.

### Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron (DLMLP) for Intrusion Prevention Systems

Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron (DLMLP) is one of the key technologies for building Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Before training, the dataset is preprocessed using **one-hot encoding**, also known as one-of-K encoding, to convert all categorical features into binary vectors. Feature scaling is then applied to normalize independent features within a fixed range. This preprocessing ensures that the transformed input to the classifier is represented as an integer matrix, where each integer corresponds to values derived from categorical and discrete features. The expected output is a sparse matrix in which each column corresponds to a possible value of a feature. To achieve consistency, input features are scaled around a mean of zero with a standard deviation of one, ensuring uniform distribution across the dataset.

After preprocessing, a **two-layer dense Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** model was constructed using **ReLU** and **SoftMax** activation functions.

#### DLMLP Architecture

In Algorithm 1, multiple deep learning (DL) layers are applied sequentially, with each layer receiving the output from the previous one. The MLP itself is a type of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) composed of one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers.

- **Input Layer**: Accepts data features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Provide hierarchical abstraction through nonlinear transformations.
- **Output Layer**: Produces predictions.

Each node (neuron) in these layers uses nonlinear activation functions, enabling the MLP to distinguish nonlinear and linearly inseparable datasets—an advantage over linear perceptrons. The model is trained using **backpropagation**, a supervised learning algorithm that updates weights to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.

During the **Intrusion Prevention (IP) stage**, the system automatically generates scripts to block malicious requests and network intrusions such as **DoS attacks**. These scripts terminate malicious connections and notify administrators of potential intrusions, enabling rapid mitigation.

#### Algorithm Deployment

The DLMLP algorithm integrates multiple components for both **intrusion detection** and **defense against cyberattacks**. A typical deployment environment includes **cloud computing infrastructure** with built-in **AI/DL capabilities** for dataset learning, training, and validation. The system addresses various attack scenarios, including **Mirai botnet**, **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**, **Reconnaissance**, **DDoS**, **DoS**, and benign traffic flows that may otherwise threaten network devices.

To achieve this, the model leverages labeled datasets combined with **AI/DL-based detection, prevention, and classification models**, including:

- **Decision Trees (DT)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)**
- **Autoencoders**

This hybrid approach enables not only attack detection but also **classification**, **prioritization**, and **automated prevention strategies** through intelligent IPS operation.

#### Model Training and Implementation

After preprocessing, the dataset is used to **train and validate** the DLMLP model. In addition to the input and output layers, the final model included more than **10 dense hidden layers**, trained using **ReLU** and **SoftMax** activations. Training was performed on the **CICIoT2023 dataset**, which captures IoT device network traffic in industrial environments.

For IPS integration, the system leverages **Linux commands (e.g., iptables)** to perform real-time traffic filtering and prevention. Algorithm 2 specifies defense strategies depending on the detected intrusion type:

- **DDoS/DoS Attacks**: Reveal the attacker’s IP address. All traffic from that IP is dropped or blocked.
- **MITM/Recon Attacks**: Expose compromised connection port numbers. All traffic through those ports is blocked.
- **Benign Traffic**: If detection classifies traffic as normal, no blocking action is taken.

#### Advantages of DLMLP in IPS

DLMLP functions similarly to biological neural networks, with multiple interconnected neurons capable of approximating complex functions. Through **backpropagation**, the model learns nonlinear relationships within the CICIoT2023 dataset, making it flexible and effective at detecting diverse intrusion patterns.

Key strengths include:

- Ability to approximate any continuous function.
- Robustness against nonlinear, high-dimensional data.
- Improved detection accuracy in IoT and cloud-based environments.

However, careful **parameter tuning** and **validation** are essential to avoid overfitting. Algorithm 2 incorporates both **feedforward** and **backpropagation** steps, updating weights iteratively to minimize prediction errors.

### Architecture of AI-Driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

AI-powered IDPS architectures are typically composed of multiple interconnected layers, each working in unison to detect anomalies, prevent attacks, and adapt to evolving threats. The main components include **data collection**, **feature extraction**, an **AI-based detection engine**, **automated response mechanisms**, and a **cloud security integration layer**.

#### Data Collection Layer

The foundation of any AI-driven IDPS lies in comprehensive data collection. Sources include:

- **Network traffic**: Capturing raw packet data, flow records, and encrypted communications.
- **Host-based logs**: Monitoring system calls, user activity, and application events.
- **Threat intelligence feeds**: Integrating external databases, security advisories, and blacklists.

## 3. Robot Intrusion Prevention Systems (RIPS): Securing Autonomous Systems in the Modern Era

Robots have become increasingly ubiquitous in our society, ranging from household vacuum cleaners and corporate service robots to healthcare assistants and autonomous vehicles. However, the security landscape for robotic systems presents unique challenges that traditional cybersecurity approaches cannot adequately address. This article explores the development and implementation of Robot Intrusion Prevention Systems (RIPS), specifically designed to protect Robot Operating System (ROS) environments from sophisticated cyber threats.

### The Security Challenge in Robotics

Historically, the robotics field, particularly in mobile robotics, has tended to exclude the use of security protocols and tools. This approach was justified because robots traditionally operated as low-exposure systems, typically running in well-controlled research environments. However, as robots become increasingly deployed in organizational and domestic settings, this assumption no longer holds true, necessitating robust mechanisms to ensure robotic systems remain secure against intrusion attempts.

Traditional network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) solutions are inadequate for autonomous robotic systems, cognitive social robots, and other types of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). These systems contain interacting digital, analog, physical, and human components, designed through the integration of physical and logical elements. While conventional IPS solutions can detect and prevent low-level communication attacks, they cannot properly inspect robotic communications or apply security-related mitigation measures at the robot level. This gap necessitates the creation of specialized Robot Intrusion Prevention Systems (RIPS) for ROS environments.

### Current Tools and Technologies

Several tools are currently available for detecting and debugging erroneous programs and monitoring ROS systems:

- **HAROS**: A framework for detecting erroneous code in ROS 2 applications
- **ARNI and Drums**: Tools for monitoring and debugging ROS1 systems
- **Vulcanexus**: A ROS 2 software stack providing libraries, tools, and simulators for tracking communication performance in eProsima Fast DDS implementations
- **ROS-FM**: A network monitoring framework for both ROS1 and ROS 2 systems, based on Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), eXpress Data Path (XDP), and the Vector visualization application
- **ROS-defender**: An integrated solution combining three different tools: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), anomaly detection systems (ROSWatch using pattern matching models), and intrusion prevention systems (ROSDN) with ROS1 firewall capabilities

Researchers have proposed various approaches for detecting attacks in robotic environments:

- **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)**: Urbina et al. conducted comprehensive reviews of attack detection methods in industrial control systems
- **Decision Tree-Based Detection**: Vuong et al. proposed methods using data collected from onboard systems and processes with decision tree algorithms
- **Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS)**: Guerrero-Higueras et al. analyzed detection methods using data from beacon-based RTLS and sensor data
- **Statistical Techniques**: Sabaliauskaite et al. proposed methods based on CUSUM statistical techniques to detect stealth attacks designed to avoid detection by exploiting system model knowledge
- **ImPACT-TRC**: A national project by Japan's Cabinet Office focusing on robotics technology for disaster response, recovery, and preparedness

### RIPS Architecture and Functionality

RIPS (Real-time Intrusion Prevention System) supports both automated (Snort-triggered) and manual (Unix signal-triggered) response mechanisms. Snort serves as the underlying low-level Intrusion Detection System (IDS), responsible for triggering alerts based on network traffic analysis. The signal function (`signal(sig:string)`) can respond to user-defined Unix signals, triggering emergency operations from the system shell when necessary.

ROS 2 is built on Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware, where components or nodes typically communicate using topics following a publisher/subscriber model. RIPS operates as a ROS 2 node, monitoring interactions between other nodes. It contains an engine for evaluating user-defined rules that instruct RIPS on how to process ROS 2 traffic and respond to each monitored message.

The system employs a comprehensive set of expression syntaxes to define "monitoring rules" for detecting and defending against threats in robotic communications. Rules primarily consist of three components: name, boolean expressions, and a set of actions executed when the boolean expression evaluates to true.

### Expression Syntax Categories

Message Events Expressions target ROS 2 **messages** for detection conditions, identifying message-level attacks such as **malicious payload injection** and **rogue nodes publishing abnormal messages**:

- `topicin` / `topicmatches` → Match based on topic names
- `publishercount` / `subscribercount` → Limit the range of publishers/subscribers for specific topics
- `publishersinclude` / `subscribersinclude` → Check if specified nodes are in publisher/subscriber lists
- `msgtypein` / `msgsubtype` → Verify message types and subtypes (e.g., `std_msgs/Header`)
- `plugin(id)` → Call external plugins for custom detection (e.g., analyzing camera frames for interference)
- `payload(path)` → Use YARA rules to detect malicious patterns in message payloads (typical malware detection approach)
- `eval(var, op, value)` → Perform conditional comparisons on message variables

Graph Events Expressions focus on ROS 2 **computational graph** detection conditions, identifying structural anomalies such as **sudden appearance of malicious nodes** or **abnormal subscriber counts**:

- `nodes` / `nodesinclude` / `nodecount` → Limit which nodes exist in the current system and their count ranges
- Similar expressions include `topics`, `services`, `topicsubscribers`, `topicpublishers` → Check the status and quantity of topics/services/subscribers/publishers
- `eval(var, op, value)` → Perform conditional judgments

External Events Expressions handle interactions with external systems, combining external security systems or manual intervention signals to trigger protective measures:

- `idsalert(alert)` → Rely on alerts from external IDS/NIPS/HIPS systems (such as Snort) for network attack warnings
- `signal(sig)` → Monitor Unix signals from the operating system (such as `SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`) to trigger emergency measures
