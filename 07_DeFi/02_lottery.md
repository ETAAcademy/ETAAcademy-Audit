## 1.[Medium] Tickets can be entered after prizes for current round have partially been distributed

### The clear end of a round

- Summary: The ThrusterTreasure contract is meant for a lottery game where users can enter tickets to win prizes. However, there's a significant flaw in the enterTickets() function. It checks if winning tickets for prize index 0 have been set but overlooks distributed prizes for higher indices. This flaw lets users enter tickets after some prizes have been distributed, giving them an unfair advantage.

- Impact & Recommendation: The flaw in the contract cannot be fixed by setting all prizes simultaneously because early-entered tickets would still miss out on rewards. To address this, there must be a clear distinction between the end of a round and the distribution of prizes to prevent users from spending funds with no chance of return.

## 2.[Medium] claimPrizesForRound transfers the entire amount deposited for a prize regardless of the number of winners

### Distribution of prizes

- Summary: The **`claimPrizesForRound()`** function transfers the entire prize amount to the first caller, ignoring the possibility of multiple winners. This denies other winners their share of the prize.

- Impact & Recommendation: It's uncertain if **`setPrize()`** amounts are for all winners or each winner individually. Scaling the owner's amount by the number of winners would be a cleaner solution.
