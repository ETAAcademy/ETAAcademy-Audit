## 1. [High] Users will never be able to withdraw their claimed airdrop fully in ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract

### Withdraw tokens fully unlocked

- Summary: The ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract manages token airdrops with a withdrawal window where users can claim tokens within a specific period and withdraw them gradually. However, once tokens are fully unlocked, users face difficulty in withdrawing their full allocated amount due to restrictions in the withdraw() function, resulting in potential losses for users who cannot time their withdrawals effectively.

- Impact & Recommendation: The ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract poses timing challenges for users to withdraw their tokens fully, leading to potential losses in claimable amounts. Adding a buffer window to the ongoingWithdrawals() modifier could help users claim their fully unlocked tokens more effectively.

## 2. [Medium] Incentive accumulation can be sandwiched with additional shares to gain advantage over long-term depositors

### No enforced unbonding period

- Summary: In this system, rewards accumulate periodically and are distributed among deposited shares. Users can swiftly deposit, claim rewards, and withdraw shares, incentivizing rapid turnover rather than long-term holding. However, this setup allows adversaries to borrow shares and unfairly claim a disproportionate share of rewards during accumulation periods. Unlike in the earnings module, there's no enforced waiting period for share withdrawals.

- Impact & Recommendation: It's recommended to track deposited shares between accumulation intervals and adjust incentive rewards based on the actual deposit duration.

## 3.[Medium] Fee and profit payments into RevenueSharingVault can be sandwiched

### Rewards without long-term staking

- Summary: The `RevenueSharingVault` contract is vulnerable to attacks where users can deposit TRNDO, trigger buy/sell fees to appreciate their shares, and quickly withdraw to earn disproportionate rewards without long-term staking.

- Impact & Recommendation: Rewards in the `RevenueSharingVault` are sent to a separate `VaultDistributor` contract, which pays out rewards slowly over a configurable timeframe. The `VaultDistributor` snapshots available rewards and distributes them linearly. This requires overriding additional functions in ERC4626.

## 4.[High] Malicious User can call lockOnBehalf repeatedly extend a users unlockTime, removing their ability to withdraw previously locked tokens

### Extend unlockTime

- Summary: The lockOnBehalf function allows a user to repeatedly lock tokens on behalf of another user, extending the recipient's unlock time indefinitely without minimum deposit required. This can prevent the original user from withdrawing their tokens and block them from reducing their lock duration.

- Impact & Recommendation: Ensure tokens locked via lockOnBehalf do not alter the recipient's lock duration, while preventing abuse such as during lockdrop NFT minting periods; or making it a two-step process where the recipient must accept or deny the lock before any changes are made to their current token lock state.

## 7.[High] Lido‚Äôs apr can be maliciously updated to 0 value due to missing getLidoUpdateTolerance check, DOS pool lending

### Timestamp validation check

- Summary: The function `updateLidoValues()` in `LidoEthBaseInterestAllocator.sol` is permissionless and lacks a timestamp validation check. This function allows anyone to update Lido's APR (`aprBps`) without restrictions. Lido‚Äôs stETH rebases daily, and a malicious actor can exploit this by calling `updateLidoValues()` between rebases, setting `aprBps` to 0. This causes the `getBaseAprWithUpdate()` function to revert with an `InvalidAprError`, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that prevents the pool from validating new offers and effectively halts lending.

- Impact & Recommendation: It's recommended to add a check ensuring `_updateLidoValues()` only executes when the time since the last update exceeds a certain tolerance, i.e., `(block.timestamp - lidoData.lastTs > getLidoUpdateTolerance)`.

## 8.[Medium] Users can evade the yDUSD vault‚Äôs withdrawal timelock mechanism

### Bypass timestamp check

- Summary: A vulnerability in the yDUSD vault‚Äôs withdrawal timelock mechanism allows attackers to bypass the 7-day withdrawal period by using another account's proposed withdrawal information. By leveraging the withdraw() function, an attacker can withdraw DUSD assets from their own account using the request details of another account, thereby evading the timelock. This breaks the vault‚Äôs core security invariant, enabling immediate withdrawals without waiting for the timelock period.

- Impact & Recommendation: Add a check to ensure the msg.sender and the owner are the same, preventing this exploit.

## 9.[Medium] Most of the FTC rewards can be taken by single entity

### Order farming

- Summary: Malicious users can quickly earn FTC rewards by opening and immediately closing positions, without actually taking on market risk. This is possible because the current implementation of the onDecreasePosition function does nothing, allowing users to collect rewards without any real position change. The protocol has a configuration (getStepMinProfitDuration) that sets a minimum duration for positions to stay open before rewards are disbursed. However, this mechanism only applies to profitable positions and doesn‚Äôt prevent users from exploiting zero-profit or small-loss positions.

- Impact & Recommendation: The team argues that the risk is low because the esFDX token, which is used for rewards, is non-transferable and under the control of the protocol. Therefore, even if users exploit this issue, they cannot immediately extract rewards. However, the document mentions "other incentives" that might be distributed alongside esFDX, which could increase the risk of manipulation. While the specifics of these incentives are unclear, their potential introduction could lead to further exploits. In conclusion, while the Flex Perpetuals team has some safeguards in place, the current design allows for possible manipulation of the reward system, and changes are recommended to mitigate this risk. The onDecreasePosition function should be modified to enforce a time window, requiring users to hold positions for a certain period before they can close them and collect rewards. If they close the position too soon, the reward should be revoked.
