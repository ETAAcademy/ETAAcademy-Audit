## 1. [High] Users will never be able to withdraw their claimed airdrop fully in ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract

### Withdraw tokens fully unlocked

- Summary: The ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract manages token airdrops with a withdrawal window where users can claim tokens within a specific period and withdraw them gradually. However, once tokens are fully unlocked, users face difficulty in withdrawing their full allocated amount due to restrictions in the withdraw() function, resulting in potential losses for users who cannot time their withdrawals effectively.

- Impact & Recommendation: The ERC20Airdrop2.sol contract poses timing challenges for users to withdraw their tokens fully, leading to potential losses in claimable amounts. Adding a buffer window to the ongoingWithdrawals() modifier could help users claim their fully unlocked tokens more effectively.

## 2. [Medium] Incentive accumulation can be sandwiched with additional shares to gain advantage over long-term depositors

### No enforced unbonding period

- Summary: In this system, rewards accumulate periodically and are distributed among deposited shares. Users can swiftly deposit, claim rewards, and withdraw shares, incentivizing rapid turnover rather than long-term holding. However, this setup allows adversaries to borrow shares and unfairly claim a disproportionate share of rewards during accumulation periods. Unlike in the earnings module, there's no enforced waiting period for share withdrawals.

- Impact & Recommendation: It's recommended to track deposited shares between accumulation intervals and adjust incentive rewards based on the actual deposit duration.
