## 1.[Medium] The winner can steal claimer fees, and force him to pay for the gas

### Use hooks to claim prize without fees

- Summary: To avoid paying transaction fees, a user can exploit a vulnerability in the Claimer contract. They can create a hook function, beforeClaimPrize, which allows them to claim their prize without paying fees and return their address. When the Claimer contract attempts to claim the prize, it fails as it has already been claimed. Using a MEV searcher, the user can then claim multiple prizes, including their own, without paying fees.

- Impact & Recommendation: One of the defense against the described attack is to check the gas cost of calling the beforeClaimPrize hook. By verifying if the prize state changes from unclaimed to claimed after the hook is called, transactions can be reverted if such a change occurs, thus preventing the attack from succeeding.
