## 1.[Medium] Lack of Slippage Protection in withdraw/redeem Functions of the Vault

### Slippage Protection

- Summary: Users in the PrizeVault expect a 1:1 exchange ratio between assets and shares when withdrawing. However, if the underlying yield vault incurs losses, this ratio can decrease. If total assets drop below total debt while a user's withdrawal is pending, they may receive fewer assets than expected, potentially causing losses.

- Impact & Recommendation: The withdraw and redeem functions in the PrizeVault lack slippage protection, potentially leading to user losses if the underlying yield vault experiences losses. To address this, users should be able to specify slippage protection parameters, such as a minimum amount for redemption or a maximum shares input for withdrawal.

## 2.[High] ReLPContract wrongfully assumes protocol owns all of the liquidity in the UniswapV2 pool

### Not calculations on the all liquidity

- Summary: The ReLPContract assumes it owns all liquidity in the UniswapV2 pool. When RdpxV2Core calls ReLPContract#reLP, it may pass incorrect amounts or trigger a revert if the protocol doesn't own the majority of LP balance. This is because the calculation assumes protocol owns all RDPX reserves, potentially leading to a denial-of-service if lpToRemove exceeds actual LP balance.

- Impact & Recommendation: Change the logic and base all calculations on the pair balance of¬†`UniV2LiquidityAmo`

## 3.[High] User can evade liquidation by depositing the minimum of tokens and gain time to not be liquidated

### Liquidation by manipulating the user.cooldownExpiration variable

- Summary: The CollateralAndLiquidity contract has a critical vulnerability that lets a user avoid liquidation by manipulating the user.cooldownExpiration variable. By depositing small amounts of tokens, users can increment the cooldownExpiration, causing liquidation attempts to fail. This could lead to system debt if liquidations are avoided.

- Impact & Recommendation: Consider modifying the¬†liquidation function

## 4.[High] When borrowers repay USDS, it is sent to the wrong address, allowing anyone to burn Protocol Owned Liquidity and build bad debt for USDS

### Bad debt from liquidations

- Summary: The Liquidizer contract burns USDS collected from users' repayments during upkeep. If there's enough USDS, it's directly burned; otherwise, Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) is converted to USDS to cover the deficit. However, the usdsThatShouldBeBurned variable is continuously increased without increasing the Liquidizer balance, forcing it to sell POL to cover the increase. If POL is exhausted, the protocol can't cover bad debt from liquidations, negatively impacting the USDS price.

- Impact & Recommendation: An attacker can exploit this by borrowing and repaying multiple times to exhaust POL or gradually over time as users repay their USDS. Therefore consider to Send the repaid USDS to the Liquidizer.

## 5.[Medium] Vault.claimRewards can break if Convex changes the operator

### Convex protocol shutdown

- Summary: The Convex protocol allows for a shutdown scenario that doesn't disrupt the BaseRewardPool, but the Vault implementation overlooks this possibility. That means if the operator changes in the Convex protocol, CVX tokens may not be minted as expected, causing the claim to fail and preventing the payout of CRV and extra rewards.

- Impact & Recommendation: Verify the CVX balance of the vault before and after the claim to ensure the correct amount has been minted.

## 6.[Medium] When Convex pool is shut down while collateral type is CurveLPStakedOnConvex, users unable to deposit that asset and protocol lose the ability to accept the asset as collateral further

### Convex protocol shutdown

- Summary: When a Convex pool associated with a collateral type is shut down, users can no longer deposit that asset into a vault due to reverts on Convex booster deposit function. Without a method to update it, the protocol loses the ability to accept it as collateral, and users may face liquidation risks. The same issue arises if Convex itself shuts down their booster contract.

- Impact & Recommendation: Update collateral type to Single and pool id to 0 when a pool or booster contract shuts down. This prevents manual staking and skips Convex deposit. Adjust withdrawERC20 to set isTokenStaked to false when withdrawing all assets, avoiding failed liquidation.
