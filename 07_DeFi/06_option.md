## 1.[High] Put settlement can be anticipated and lead to user losses and bonding DoS

### Put settlement

- Summary: Liquidity providers in PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP can anticipate potential losses from in-the-money put options, allowing them to withdraw liquidity before losses occur. This creates a disadvantage for slower or less technically savvy users. The issue is rooted in the predictability of settlement price thresholds and the LPs' ability to redeem collateral at any time, potentially draining available collateral and hindering market participation for other users.

- Impact & Recommendation: The severity is high because new depositors face guaranteed losses without a clear solution. Possible fixes include implementing a "cooling off period" for withdrawals or minting more shares to reward long-term holders, but both options impact the project's token economics.

## 2.[High] Put settlement can be anticipated and lead to user losses and bonding DoS

### Set minimum¬† timeToExpiry

- Summary: The problem occurs in the PerpetualAtlanticVault contract when attempting to purchase options. If the time difference between the next funding payment and the current block time is less than 864 seconds, it causes the option pricing to use a time to expiry of 0, resulting in a revert. This leads to unexpected reverts approximately every 14 minutes during each funding epoch.

- Impact & Recommendation: Set minimum¬† timeToExpiry ¬†inside¬† calculatePremium.

## 3.[High] Closing a SR during a wrong redemption proposal leads to loss of funds

### Collateral added to closed SR by disputed Redemption

- Summary: A vulnerability in the DittoETH protocol can lead to a loss of funds when closing a Short Record (SR) during a wrong redemption proposal. When a user creates a redemption proposal with the proposeRedemption function, they must provide a list of SRs with the lowest collateral ratios (CR) in ascending order. If the list is incorrect, anyone can dispute it using the disputeRedemption function. However, if an SR is closed (due to liquidation, exiting, or transfer) between proposing and disputing, its collateral is added to the closed SR and cannot be recovered.

- Impact & Recommendation: Reopening closed SRs could resolve the issue but might be misused to avoid liquidations.
