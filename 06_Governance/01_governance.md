## 1.[Medium] Governance logic may enter a deadlock

### Key actors manipulate governance mechanism

- Summary: If compromised, key actors like the security council or owner could prevent upgrades or manipulate the governance mechanism, leading to operational challenges.
- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this the possibility of a governance deadlock , suggested solutions include restricting the cancel permission to only the owner, and implementing a minimum upgrade delay to prevent instant upgrades, giving users time to react in case of malicious actions.

  ```solidity

    -   function cancel(bytes32 _id) external onlyOwnerOrSecurityCouncil {
    +   function cancel(bytes32 _id) external onlyOwner {
            require(isOperationPending(_id), "Operation must be pending");
            delete timestamps[_id];
            emit OperationCancelled(_id);
        }

        function updateDelay(uint256 _newDelay) external onlySelf {
    +       require(_newDelay >= MINIMUM_UPGRADE_DELAY, "whatever";)
            emit ChangeMinDelay(minDelay, _newDelay);
            minDelay = _newDelay;
        }

## 2. [Medium] Re-triggering the canOffboard[term] flag to bypass the DAO vote of the lending term offboarding mechanism

### Offboarding lending term

- Summary: The vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly trigger offboarding a re-onboarding lending term, bypassing the DAO vote offboarding mechanism. Even after the term is offboarded and cleaned up, the attacker can trigger another offboarding vote before the poll ends, to re-trigger the¬†`canOffboard[term]`¬†flag. This enables the attacker to force offboarding of the re-onboarded term at any time, overriding the DAO vote.

- Impact & Recommendation: The attack not only manipulates offboarding but also triggers silent auctions for existing loans. If a loan fails to attract bids, causing a loss, stakers who voted for the term via the SurplusGuildMinter contract are slashed, impacting both borrowers and stakers significantly. Prevent the offboarding poll from reactivating the `canOffboard[term]` flag after the lending term cleanup, or end the poll if the term has been cleaned up.
