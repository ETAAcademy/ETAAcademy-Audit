## 1.[Medium] Governance logic may enter a deadlock

### Key actors manipulate governance mechanism

- Summary: If compromised, key actors like the security council or owner could prevent upgrades or manipulate the governance mechanism, leading to operational challenges.
- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this the possibility of a governance deadlock , suggested solutions include restricting the cancel permission to only the owner, and implementing a minimum upgrade delay to prevent instant upgrades, giving users time to react in case of malicious actions.

    -   function cancel(bytes32 _id) external onlyOwnerOrSecurityCouncil {
    +   function cancel(bytes32 _id) external onlyOwner {
            require(isOperationPending(_id), "Operation must be pending");
            delete timestamps[_id];
            emit OperationCancelled(_id);
        }

        function updateDelay(uint256 _newDelay) external onlySelf {

            emit ChangeMinDelay(minDelay, _newDelay);
            minDelay = _newDelay;

## 2.[Medium] Borrowers can avoid the payment of an interest share fee by setting themselves as a fee_receipient

### fee_receipient

- Summary: Borrowers can avoid the 20% interest share fee by specifying a fee recipient account they control, bypassing the intended fee payment mechanism.

- Impact & Recommendation: Apply restrictions on the fee_receipient by making it a property of the Pool struct, set during the creation of each new trading pool by its operator.

## 3.[High] Malicious contracts could become agents

### Agents set when proposed

- Summary: Once the proposal is processed, the malicious contract becomes an agent and can exploit critical functions protected by the `onlyAgent` modifier in the `masterDAO` contract, such as `updateContract`, `addDuty`, and `removeDuty`.

- Impact & Recommendation: To mitigate this issue, agents should only be set after a proposal has been resolved, not when it is proposed.
